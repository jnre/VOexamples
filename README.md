VO! examples with opencv

project to better understand VO with opencv

1) feature detection and description
2) feature matching
3) homography transform 
    - through PnP where size of object is required, but scaling is given
    - through homography transform of feature matching, no scaling (not very accurate)
    - homography transform -> rotation and velocity of camera to frame 1 and camera to frame 2 thru PnP
4) manipulation to frame 1 to fram 2 camera
